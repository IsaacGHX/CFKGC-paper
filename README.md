# CFULF
This repo shows the source code of paper: Continual Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed to equip the few-shot model with the ability to learn sequentially from novel relations. Specifically, we introduce innovative strategies at
both the data and model levels: data-level rehearsal and model-level
modulation to address catastrophic forgetting, alongside multi-view
relation augmentation aimed at resolving the issue of insufficient
novel relations.
